# IAS Processor and Assembler-Von Neumann Architecture

## Project Overview
This project implements a simulation of the IAS (Von Neumann) processor, capable of executing assembly code instructions in a simulated environment. The project includes an assembler that converts assembly instructions into machine code and a processor that executes these instructions based on the IAS architecture. The framework is designed to be extensible, with support for general operations and custom instructions.

In this repository I have implemented it for calculating magnitude of the resultant vector from N 2D vectors, given their x and y components. 
## Project files
1. **ASSEMBLER.py**  
   This Python file serves as the assembler. It reads an assembly code file, converts the instructions into machine code, and stores the output in `MACHINE_CODE.txt`.

2. **MACHINE_CODE.txt**  
   The binary representation of the machine code, generated by the assembler. This file serves as the memory for the processor simulation.

3. **PROCESSOR.py**  
   This Python file simulates the IAS processor. It reads the binary machine code from `MACHINE_CODE.txt` and simulates instruction execution. It provides detailed feedback on the state of the processor, including the values in registers and how data is transferred through the system.

4. **ASSEMBLY_CODE.txt**  
   A sample file that contains assembly instructions for the IAS processor. You can modify this file to simulate different programs.

## Custom Instructions

In addition to the standard IAS instructions, the following custom instructions have been added:

| Instruction     | Opcode      | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **SQRT**        | `11111110`  | Takes the square root of the value in the AC (Accumulator) and stores the integer part in AC and the first two decimals in MQ (Multiplier Quotient). |
| **SQUARE M(X)** | `10101010`  | Squares the value at memory location `X` and stores the result in AC.        |
| **DEC**         | `01111111`  | Decrements the value in AC by 1.                                             |
| **HALT**        | `11111111`  | Terminates the program.                                                      |

## Running the Simulation

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Setup:**
   Place the following files in the same directory:
   - `ASSEMBLER.py`
   - `PROCESSOR.py`
   - `ASSEMBLY_CODE.txt` (or any other assembly code you want to simulate)
   - `MACHINE_CODE.txt` (output generated by the assembler)

2. **Install required packages:**
   To run the processor with color-coded output, you need the `colorama` package. Install it using:
   ```bash
   pip install colorama
   ```
3. **Assemble the code**: To convert the assembly instructions from `ASSEMBLY_CODE.txt `into machine code, run:
``` bash
python3 ASSEMBLER.py
```
This will generate the machine code in `MACHINE_CODE.txt`.

4. **Run the Processor**-
 After assembling the code, execute the processor to simulate the IAS machine:
 ```bash
 python3 PROCESSOR.py
```
5. **View Output** -
The processor will display a step-by-step breakdown of instruction execution, register values, and data transfer. Color coding is used for different phases of the instruction cycle:
* Red: Register values
* Yellow: Beginning or completion of a phase
* Blue: Decode of the instruction register (IR)
* Green: Description of the current instruction

## Customizing the Program

### Modifying Assembly Code
You can change the assembly program by editing `ASSEMBLY_CODE.txt`. The file should follow the IAS assembly syntax, using both standard and custom instructions. After modifying the assembly code, re-run the assembler and processor to see the results.
### Adding Custom Instructions
You can extend the processor by adding new instructions to `PROCESSOR.py`. Define new opcodes and corresponding operations, ensuring to handle memory and register interactions correctly.

### Example Assembly Code
Here is an example of assembly code for squaring a number and calculating the square root:
``` bash 
LDA M(10)    # Load value from memory address 10 into the accumulator
SQUARE M(10) # Square the value in memory address 10
SQRT         # Calculate the square root of the value in the accumulator
HALT         # Stop the program
```
This will load a value from memory, square it, compute its square root, and then halt.

### Example Output 
When running `PROCESSOR.py`, the output will display each phase of instruction execution, register contents, and how data moves between the memory and registers, using color codes for clarity.
